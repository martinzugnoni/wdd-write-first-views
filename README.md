# Writing your first views

In this assignment we will start playing with the Django Views Layer.

You will be practicing topics like:
- Write URL rules to match your views
- Handle GET and POST requests with proper params
- Use Django view decorators to force certain pre conditions
- Return both HTML and JSON responses
- Handle HTTP status codes: 3xx, 4xx, etc

For better understanding of what's required to complete this assignment, we always recommend to take a detailed look at test cases. They are the best specification of all the use cases that need to be implemented.

### How to start?

All you have to do is complete the views code in `students_crud/students/views.py`. Each view already provide a docstring with the explanation of what the view is supposed to do. Make sure all tests pass before pushing your changes.
